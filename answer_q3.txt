question 3:
we get two different images, in the magnitude calculated using convolution we get more explicit lines representing
the diff than the magnitude calculated using fourier transform.
that is because convolution is defined as linear and continuous and the method using fourier transform is discrete
and that is why when we calculate the derivative using fourier transform we lose some of the information and
get less explicit lines in the magnitude.
