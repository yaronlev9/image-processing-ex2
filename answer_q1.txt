question 1:
in change_rate i get higher frequencies than from the original because when i multiply the rate, the frequencies of the
waves get bigger and the duration speeds up, in change samples we convert to fourier signal and cut high frequencies
(the edges of the fourier signal), that is why we get a speed up version without high frequencies.
